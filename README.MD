####The project is email automation challenge comprising of 3 challenges:

Challenge #1
Extract the email address from a string (without using RegEx)

Given a string containing one email address, create a workflow to extract the email address without using regular expressions.

Note: Your input for this automation is a sentence from the user that contains one email address. What this means is that in your automation you will prompt the user for the sentence input.

Challenge #2 
 Extract the email address from a string (using RegEx)

Given a string containing one email address, create a workflow to extract the email address using regular expressions. 

Note: Just like challenge #1, the input is from the user.

Challenge #3
To make things interesting for both of the challenges above, once you've extracted the email from the users sentence, send an email to the email address extracted. Create your own email template that tells the owner of the email extracted that their email addess has been extracted successuflly.
